# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction & Risk Analysis | Multi-Company | ML-Driven Forecasting

---

## Executive Summary

This project focuses on predictive modeling and risk analysis of stock price trends for six leading companies â€” AMD, ASUS, Intel, NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Amazon â€” using historical data ranging from 1980 to 2023.

Utilizing machine learning regressors (Random Forest, HistGradientBoosting), statistical methods (ARIMA), and financial technical indicators, this project delivers a comprehensive Python-based analytics solution. The model forecasts future prices, evaluates volatility and performance, and provides insights into daily return trends.

## Modeling Approach

* **Preprocessing:** Date formatting, missing value handling, computation of rolling statistics
* **Feature Engineering:** Technical indicators calculated using basic pandas operations
* **Train/Test Split:** 80/20 split with time-based ordering
* **Models Applied:**

  * Random Forest Regressor
  * Histogram-based Gradient Boosting Regressor
  * ARIMA with exogenous features

---

## Evaluation Metrics

* **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** used to evaluate model performance.
* **Visual comparison** of predicted vs actual closing prices.

---

## Forecast Output

Each company includes:

* Technical indicator visualizations
* Forecast plots for the next 30â€“100 days
* RMSE results
* Model comparison charts

---

## Learning Outcomes

* Built end-to-end ML pipelines for financial time-series
* Applied ensemble methods and statistical forecasting models
* Engineered financial indicators without external libraries
* Developed modular, readable Python scripts
* Enhanced understanding of stock price dynamics
